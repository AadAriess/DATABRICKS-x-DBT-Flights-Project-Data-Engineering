## üîç What We'll Learn

This project will walk you through a complete data engineering lifecycle, from data ingestion to advanced data modeling and reporting. You'll gain practical experience with industry-standard tools and concepts.

#### Key Concepts & Technologies:
- **Databricks Platform**: Learn to navigate and utilize key features of Azure Databricks, including Unity Catalog for centralized data governance.
- **Data Ingestion**: Implement efficient, incremental data ingestion using PySpark Streaming and Databricks Autoloader.
- **Declarative Pipelines**: Build and orchestrate robust ETL/ELT pipelines using Delta Live Tables (DLT).
- **Data Modeling**: Apply core data warehousing principles, including building Dimensional Data Models and handling Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs).
- **Orchestration**: Schedule and manage your data workflows with Databricks Jobs.
- **Transformations**: Use dbt (data build tool) to define and manage your data transformations.
- **Real-World Application**: Understand how these tools fit together in a cohesive Medallion Architecture.

## üöÄ Project Requirements

### Data Engineering Pipeline

#### Objective
Develop an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Databricks and its ecosystem to transform raw data into a structured, analytics-ready format.

#### Specifications
- **Architecture**: Implement a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to progressively refine data quality and structure.
- **Data Ingestion**: Ingest raw data incrementally into the Bronze layer using Databricks Autoloader.
- **Transformations**: Use Delta Live Tables to declaratively define transformations and move data from the Bronze to Silver and Gold layers.
- **Data Modeling**: Build a robust dimensional data model in the Gold layer, including fact and dimension tables.
- **Documentation**: The project provides a clear breakdown of each step, from setting up your environment to answering common interview questions, to help you understand the entire process.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Flights Report**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
